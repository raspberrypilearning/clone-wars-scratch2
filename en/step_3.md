## Lightning bolts

Now you are going to give the spaceship the ability to fire lightning bolts!

--- task ---

Add the `Lightning` sprite from the Scratch library.  

[[[generic-scratch-sprite-from-library]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

When the game starts, the `Lightning` sprite should be hidden until the spaceship fires its laser cannons.

Add this code to the `Lightning` sprite:

--- /task ---

At the moment, the lightning bolt is really big compared to the spaceship!

--- task ---

Below the code that the `Lightning` sprite already has, add some blocks to make the sprite smaller and to turn it upside down.

Now it looks like it fires pointy endâ€“first out of the spaceship.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add some new code to the `Spaceship` sprite to create a new clone of the lightning bolt if the <kbd>space</kbd> key is pressed.

--- hints ---

--- hint ---

`When the green flag is clicked`{:class="blockevents"}, keep checking `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} the `space key is pressed`{:class="blocksensing"}, and in that case `create a clone of the Lightning`{:class="blockcontrol"} sprite.

Here are the blocks you need:

Here is what your new code should look like:

--- /hints ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Whenever the game creates a `Lightning` sprite clone, the clone should appear and then move upwards until it reaches the top of the Stage. Then the clone should disappear.

Add this code to the `Lightning` sprite so that clones of it move upwards until they touch the edge of the Stage, and then they get deleted.

--- task ---

Press the <kbd>space</kbd> key to test whether the lightning bolt moves correctly.
